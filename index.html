# Communicate

Write down decisions, and share them, publicly

Overcommunicate

Don't expect an immediate answer

# Communicate

> Not everything that would have ordinarily been an in-office meeting or
in-office watercooler chat has to now be a Slack DM. Prefer working in public,
and some things can even be emails or whatever other async tech you use. --
Andy

# Communicate

> Write s**t down more. Donâ€™t count on someone being able to drop everything
and talk to you for 5 minutes when it could have been an email/issue/slack/text
-- Aziz

# Communicate

> Realize that you will be out of the loop of the things that might be said
near a watercooler, they don't go away, they just may change so find other ways
to stay engaged -- Sally

---

# Communicate

> Use emoji. ðŸ¥° They aren't cute optional stickers. They're your most powerful
tool to convey emotion through text. See the difference between "Okay." and
"Okay. ðŸ˜„"? "Chat literacy" as I've called it is going to be critical to the
success of a remote team and org. -- Mitchell

---

# Communicate

> Discuss and agree on some ground rules with your spouse or partner. Decide
what things can interrupt a closed door or headphones on situation, and also
when working hours are and are not. by talking about it up front you can avoid
misunderstandings or hurt feelings. -- brandon

# Home Office

- Have a separate office space if you can
- Ensure you have decent internet connection and equipment
- Invest in an ergonomic setup
- Get a standing desk and good chair if you can
- Get an ultrawide monitor if you can
- I highly recommend facing an open window with plenty of sunlight if you can

# Home Office

> You donâ€™t need a DSLR to make your camera look decent in Zoom. A good
lighting source on your face, proper positioning of the webcam, and framing
yourself properly will do wonders. -- Will

I'm sure I still have a lot to learn, but here's some tidbits from a guy who built a company with 800+ remote employees (myself included of course) and what that has taught me." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1237540980888199170?lang=en)
