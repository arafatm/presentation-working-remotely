# Be Kind and Assume Good Intent

- Check in with each other as people
- Overcommunicate
- Don't expect an immediate answer
- Expect people to be distracted by home situation to varying degrees

### Write down decisions, and share them, publicly

---

> Not everything that would have ordinarily been an in-office meeting or in-office watercooler chat has to now be a Slack DM. Prefer working in public, and some things can even be emails or whatever other async tech you use. -- Andy

---

> Write s**t down more. Don’t count on someone being able to drop everything and talk to you for 5 minutes when it could have been an email/issue/slack/text -- Aziz

---

> Realize that you will be out of the loop of the things that might be said near a watercooler, they don't go away, they just may change so find other ways to stay engaged -- Sally

`"Discuss and agree on some ground rules with your spouse or partner. decide what things can interrupt a closed door or headphones on situation, and also when working hours are and are not. by talking about it up front you can avoid misunderstandings or hurt feelings."` -- bval

# Home Office

- Have a separate office space if you can
- Ensure you have a decent internet connection
- Invest in an ergonomic setup
- Get a standing desk and good chair if you can
- Get an ultrawide monitor if you can
- I highly recommend facing an open window with plenty of sunlight if you can

> You don’t need a DSLR to make your camera look decent in Zoom. A good lighting source on your face, proper positioning of the webcam, and framing yourself properly will do wonders. -- Will

I'm sure I still have a lot to learn, but here's some tidbits from a guy who built a company with 800+ remote employees (myself included of course) and what that has taught me." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1237540980888199170?lang=en)
