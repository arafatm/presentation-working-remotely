# Be Kind and Assume Good Intent

- Assume good intent
- Overcommunicate
- Check in with each other as people
- Don't expect an immediate answer
- Expect people to be distracted by home situation to varying degrees

# Ground Rules

- `"Discuss and agree on some ground rules with your spouse or partner. decide what things can interrupt a closed door or headphones on situation, and also when working hours are and are not. by talking about it up front you can avoid misunderstandings or hurt feelings."`

---

# Home Office

- Have a separate office space if you can
- Ensure you have a decent internet connection
- Invest in an ergonomic setup
- Get a standing desk and good chair if you can
- Get an ultrawide monitor if you can
- `You donâ€™t need a DSLR to make your camera look decent in Zoom. A good lighting source on your face, proper positioning of the webcam, and framing yourself properly will do wonders.`

`I highly recommend facing an open window with plenty of sunlight if you can`

I'm sure I still have a lot to learn, but here's some tidbits from a guy who built a company with 800+ remote employees (myself included of course) and what that has taught me." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1237540980888199170?lang=en)
